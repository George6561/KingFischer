 * Class: MoveStorage
 *
 * This class is used to store moves and their scores during a game. Each move
 * is represented as an array containing the board state and the move score.
 * It provides functionalities to store moves, retrieve the history, and display
 * the move history as a formatted string.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Storing board states and their scores as a list.
 * - Clearing the move history.
 * - Converting the move history to a formatted string for display.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - `ChessBoard` for representing the current state of the chessboard.
